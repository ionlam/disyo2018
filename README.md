# disyo (distributed system ontology)

## Project statement
Create – possibly, by reusing (parts of) existing ontologies – an ontological model regarding certain aspects – data communication, data processing, data storage, etc. – regarding a distributed system (including platform, framework,...) used in the context of big data – for details, see The New Stack. Starting with this conceptual specification, a testbed application will be developed. Significant concepts, relations, restrictions, individuals should be considered as examples for a real software tool like Apache Hadoop – consult also Hadoop content on InfoQ (of course, another existing distributed system – e.g., Git Large File Storage – might be taken into account). A testbed application will be implemented in order to manage the collected knowledge. See also Awesome distributed systems.
